# Project Medical Insurance Costs
The project "U.S. Medical Insurance Costs" suggested by Codeacademia during the Data Scientist (2021 version) Course. 

Developer: Ksenia Pustozerova

**Overview**
---------------
For this project, I have investigated a medical insurance costs dataset in a .csv file using the Python skills. I was tasked with working with the actual information in the dataset and performing my own independent analysis on real-world data. The insurance.csv file includes information about patients: age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, geographical region and insurance charge.
